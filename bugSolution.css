To fix this, make sure that the parent element has its dimensions defined, either explicitly or implicitly (e.g., through content). If the parent's dimensions are dynamic, consider using a JavaScript solution or alternative CSS techniques to achieve the desired layout.  Here is an example of how to correct the issue by ensuring the parent container has a defined width:

```css
/* bugSolution.css */
.container {
  width: 500px; /* Define the parent's width */
}

.element {
  width: calc(100% - 10px);
}
```
