This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the `calc()` function in CSS. The issue arises when `calc()` is used to calculate a dimension based on a percentage of a parent element's dimension, but the parent element's dimension is not defined or is dynamic.  The `bug.css` file contains the erroneous code, resulting in unexpected behavior.  The `bugSolution.css` file provides a corrected solution to resolve this issue.
